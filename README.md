# DrivEye: Advanced Driver Assistance System

## Overview
DrivEye is a mobile application developed to enhance road safety by measuring the distance between vehicles in real-time using object detection technology based on the YOLOv5 model. This system offers an economical alternative to traditional sensors and lidar technologies, enabling effective distance measurement with just a smartphone camera.

## Problem Statement
Traffic accidents are a major global issue, with thousands of lives lost each year. One of the primary causes of these accidents is the failure of drivers to maintain a safe distance from vehicles ahead. DrivEye aims to address this problem by providing real-time distance measurements and alerts to help drivers maintain safe driving distances.

## Features
- Real-time vehicle detection and distance measurement using a smartphone camera.
- Object detection based on the YOLOv5 model with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 90%.
- Predicts the distance between vehicles with an accuracy of 94.08%.
- Provides early warnings when the distance is too close, improving driver awareness and safety.

## Results
- **Mean Average Precision (mAP):** 90%
- **Distance Prediction Accuracy:** 94.08%

## Conclusion
DrivEye demonstrates the potential of smartphone-based solutions in enhancing road safety. By leveraging advanced object detection technologies, it offers a practical and cost-effective way to assist drivers in maintaining safe distances, ultimately contributing to a reduction in traffic accidents.
